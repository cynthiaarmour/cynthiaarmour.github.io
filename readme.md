[Cynthia Armour Read Me]( index.html )
===

I live in Oakland, California. 

I ride a bike, take the train, and drive someone else's car. 

I am an advocate for active transportation networks. 
There is no silver bullet to the transportation question. 
Rather, what we need is a portfolio of options, each additional one increasing our mobility. 
An active network offers a variety of ways to get from A to B, all efficient in their own sense.
