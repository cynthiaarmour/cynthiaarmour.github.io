_Oakland Gran Fondo 2016 3D Viewer_

* Stripped down auto-run version for 'video of the week' on the way


## Program

* Link for the 'Video of the Week' slot in the email blast
	* Ready for demos, testing and gathering approvals ready by midday Wednesday, 2016-09-14
	* All work complete by 2016-09-15
	* Just in case: probably good idea to have an alternate link available
	* Link will go to an animated 3D web app that will ride you through the Oakland Gran Fondo 28
* Links for all four rides for the [Oakland Gran Fondo]( http://www.oaklandgranfondo.com ) site
	* Ready for demos, testing and gathering approvals ready by Wednesday, 2016-09-21
	* Each link will go to an animated 3D web app custom-tailored for the particular ride

## Concept

Maps are usually flat. Bike routes usually are not flat. Looking at the usual map it's hard to see where the tricky bits of the route are going to be.

As mobile devices become more powerful, it's going to be possible to visualize routes in entirely new ways.

It's time to leave 2D flatland and explore the hills and valleys of new ways of animated 3D mapping 



### Mission

_a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future _

* To make it easier for people to see the easy and difficult sections of routes


### Vision

_a descriptive picture of a desired future state_

* To help people discover new ways of getting where they want to go


## Features

* All work is built as free, open source software ([FOSS]())
* All code and data is available on this GitHub repository
* Code is written so as to be readable by entry level programmers
